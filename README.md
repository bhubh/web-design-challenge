# web-design-challenge
In this project we use the results of plots and data from the weather data to create a website. We used bootstrap 5 template and additional CSS styling to modify the website. We added navigation bar with link for homepage, data, comparison and a dropdown menu for links to individual plots.

# use converting data in csv into html table
We used pandas Dataframe to read and convert the data file in CSV into the html table. The html table was then added into the data link in nav-bar.

# The following html files are used to build the web:
1. Index.html: leads to the homepage
2. temperature.html: leads to the page with lot of maximum temperature with Latitude co-ordinate of the location where the temperatures were recorded.
3. humidity.html:  leads to the page with plot of humidity and latitude.
4. cloudiness.html: leads to the page with plot of cloudiness with latitude of different cities. 
5. windspeed.html: leads to the page containing plot and description of windspeed vs latitude variation for different cities.
